## ⛔️ DO NOT SHARE YOUR AUTH TOKEN! ⛔️ ##

Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure do not post screenshots, or logs on the internet.

## Security Concerns

Using third-party scripts means you trust that the script’s developer hasn’t inserted malicious functionality into the code and has secured it against attackers trying to do the same. You should never run code you don't trust.

Please read: [what I'm doing to ensure this is safe for users][security_policy].
